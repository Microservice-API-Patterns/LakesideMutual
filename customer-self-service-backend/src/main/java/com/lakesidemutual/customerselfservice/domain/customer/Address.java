/**
 * An Address is a value object that is used to represent the postal address of a customer.
 *
 * You might be wondering why the Address class implements the ValueObject interface even though it has a JPA @Entity annotation.
 * This discrepancy exists for technical reasons. JPA requires Address to be declared as an entity, because it is part of a one-to-many
 * relationship. However, in the DDD sense, Address behaves like a value object.
 *
 * You also might be wondering why this code is the same as that in the Customer Core. This does violate DRY but for
 * good reasons: strategic DD suggests that model boundaries decouple (sub-)systems so that they can be deployed and
 * evolved independently.
